# Racetrack_Wagering_Log
Do-it-yourself localhost Web site for horse racing enthusiasts to keep track of their wagers. Requires a running Web server on your local Linux system along with MySQL to hold the data. You should have php-mysql installed (not plain old php).

See the Wiki for directions.

Note: designed for simple wagers only: win, place, show, exactas, etc. The wagered amounts provided in the drop-down menu are modest but can be modified by fiddling with the values listed on the relevant HTML pages along with their corresponding entries in MySQL.
