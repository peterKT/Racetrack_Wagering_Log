# Racetrack_Wagering_Log
Do-it-yourself localhost Web site for horse racing enthusiasts to keep track of their wagers.
Requires a running Web server on your local Linux system along with MySQL to hold the data.
See the Wiki for directions.

Note: designed for single-horse wagers only. If you want to keep track of multiple-horse wagers like exactas and triples, you will have to add your own code.
