# Racetrack_Wagering_Log

This little system is for all those horse racing fans who like to keep track of their wagering history and find spreadsheets woefully inadequate. With it, you simply click to select several wager parameters like the track, date, distance, type of wager and amount. Then enter the name of the horse and submit. The wager is now part of a permanent record that can be viewed anytime in a Web browser, with the view sortable on several key categories.

Requires a running Web server on your Linux system along with MySQL to hold the data. You should also have php-mysql installed (not plain old php).

See the Wiki for directions.

Note: designed for simple wagers only: win, place, show, exactas, etc.

Note: On April 24, 2021, I fiddled with the settings which seem to be needed to actually make the code available on GitHut. Hope it works.
