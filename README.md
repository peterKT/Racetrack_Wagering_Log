# Racetrack_Wagering_Log
This project was updated in January 2021 and there are lots of changes in the Web pages. Plus the MySQL wagers table has been altered significantly.

But this is still a do-it-yourself localhost Web site for horse racing enthusiasts to keep track of their wagers. Requires a running Web server on your Linux system along with MySQL to hold the data. You should also have php-mysql installed (not plain old php).

See the Wiki for directions.

Note: designed for simple wagers only: win, place, show, exactas, etc.
