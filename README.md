# Racetrack_Wagering_Log
Do-it-yourself localhost Web site for horse racing enthusiasts to keep track of their wagers. Requires a running Web server on your local Linux system along with MySQL to hold the data. You should have php-mysql installed (not plain old php).

See the Wiki for directions.

Note: designed for single-horse wagers only. If you want to keep track of multiple-horse wagers like exactas and triples, you will have to modify code. This is simple HTMP/PHP text so that should not be difficult if you know the basics.
